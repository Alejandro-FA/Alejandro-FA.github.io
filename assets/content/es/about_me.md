I recently graduated in _**Computer Engineering**_, where I discovered my passion for _**Programming**_ and _**Artificial Intelligence**_. I am looking for opportunities to deepen my knowledge of these topics and apply it to real-world applications. In my free time, you will find me with my friends, doing sports or playing video games.

If you are interested in my work, I invite you to check my [resume](/cv), my [projects](/projects), or the [research](/research) I have done.
