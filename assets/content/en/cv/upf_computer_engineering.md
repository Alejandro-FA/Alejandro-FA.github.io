My four-year academic journey in Physics Engineering led me to discover my passion for computer engineering and programming. I graduated in Computer Engineering in second place, completing 20 subjects with Honours ("Matr√≠cula de Honor" in Spanish). These subjects, including Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography and Security, Object-Oriented Programming, Machine Learning, and Algorithm Design, are a testament to my strong technical skills and academic achievements.

One of the most rewarding aspects of my Bachelor's degree was the opportunity to collaborate on multiple team projects with brilliant colleagues. This experience honed my fundamental skills in collaborative planning and organization, technical communication, and synchronous and asynchronous collaboration in software development.
